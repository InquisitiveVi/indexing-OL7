# Inclusive Integrated Indexing 
Creating equitable access to new knowledge !

Hello !
Thanks for visiting this repository. The README file will help you understand more about **Inclusive Integrated Indexing** project and how you can get involved. 

Vision: To create a community driven index of all research outputs by overcoming barriers to accessibility. 

Inclusive Integrated Indexing is a comprehensive community driven open platform to capture all research outputs with digital identifiers. Researchers often use indexing databases and similar services to search for relevant information. Currently available indexing databases and search services curate peer-reviewed journal articles (Medline, Scopus etc), preprint (Prepubmed) or text based (Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic). Such indexing excludes the visibility of other non-traditional research outputs such as protocols, observations, data sets and figures. At times peer-reviewed articles from select fields and indigenous communities. Inclusive Integrated Indexing will serve to integrate all of them on an online platform which is free and open to use.

Contributions and collaborations are welcome in the following areas:
1) Defining and Structuring the online platform (advisory committee) 
2) Building the online platform (developers)
3) Testing the design and usability (user experience and design testers)
